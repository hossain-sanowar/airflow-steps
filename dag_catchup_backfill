I will demonstrate the airflow catchup and backfill that are necessary for you to run dag in historical time.
ðŸ‘‰ What are the catchup and backfill
ðŸ‘‰ How to use catchup
ðŸ‘‰ How to use backfill

- Create a simple Airflow DAG
- Set start date in the past and enable catchup
- Disable catchup by setting it to False
- Using backfill command to fill dag run in the past
- Backfilled dag run displayed in the airflow ui

Change time interval in docker:
- docker ps
- docker exec -it 12feb3857af0 bash
- airflow dags backfill -s 2022-11-05 -e 2022-11-13 dag_with_catchup_backfill_v02
